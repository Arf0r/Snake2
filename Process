## day 3
Install framework on my mac. libGDX does not work with jave 10+ so I had to downgrade to java 8, this was harder than I
anticipated because java automatically installs multiple versions rather than replaces old ones. I used homebrew to install
java 8 via terminal.

## Day 4
libGDX works with different "screens" in stead of with XML layout files. These screens implement the fucntional aspect as well
as the visual aspect of the app. Shapes and text can be drawn on the screens using the render method that you have to 
make on every screen. Using an "Orhtographic camera" the view that is shown to the user is identified, and within this view
"shapeRenderers can be used to create shapes, such as the rectangles needed in snake

In this image you can see a single white rectangle that will be the snakes head.
In the oncoming days I will focus on creating a grid and moving the square on that grid.

## Day 5
Moving the head over the grid proved quite easy so I went on to having body parts following the head.
I had to decide on one of two ways of doing this:
- Having all the individual pieces follow the head in a train like fashion
- Moving the last body part to the front and leaving the ones in the middle at the same position

I chose to go with the latter option because it requires less movement and thus less actions to execute for the computer
and less actions for me to program.
