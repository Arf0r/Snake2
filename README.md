# Snake
This is an android application that allows the user to play the absolute classic game snake!

## Problem
In a day and age where games are getting more and more advanced, sometimes the best way to relax is to go back to the roots. Snake is a classic game that speaks to people of all ages all around the world, now brought in the classic format to your modern phones.

## Solution
As a framework to build games with libGDX will be used. libGDX is a fairly well documented framework that can be used with JAVA and can be used for android as well as IOS.

## Prerequisites
- I will be using libGDX as a framework for building games
- As snake is a classic game it similar projects exist, most work with a keyboard of buttons for up, down, right, left. So ill have to find a way to implement swiping listeners
- The hardest part of this project will be figuring out the syntax of the libGDX framework
